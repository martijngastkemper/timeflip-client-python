# Connect with Timeflip

I frist tried to make [a NodeJS version](https://github.com/martijngastkemper/timeflip-client), but that didn't work out. With [the Python package Bleak](https://github.com/hbldh/bleak) it works much better. It just works on MacOS.

The goal with this client is to connect Timeflip with Productive. To easily which between tasks.

## Usage

Install Python 3 and check out the source.

Run `python main.py`.
